Input:

Read the number of elements n.
Read the n elements into an array.
Read the value search to find in the array.

Initialization:

Set first = 0 (index of the first element).
Set last = n - 1 (index of the last element).
Calculate middle = (first + last) / 2 (the middle index).

Binary Search Loop:

While first <= last, repeat the following steps:
If array[middle] < search, update first = middle + 1 (search the right half).
If array[middle] == search, print "search found at location middle + 1" and exit the loop.
If array[middle] > search, update last = middle - 1 (search the left half).
Recalculate middle = (first + last) / 2.

Termination:

If first > last, print "Not found! search is not present in the list."
